# 0x08 Networking basics #1 :wrench:

> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers the part2 of network concepts for DevOps development this project has now bash scripts

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* What is localhost/127.0.0.1
* What is 0.0.0.0
* What is /etc/hosts
* How to display your machine’s active network interfaces

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. What is localhost?
1. What is 0.0.0.0?
2. Script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements.
3. Script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine it’s executed on.
4. Script that listens on port 98 on localhost.
