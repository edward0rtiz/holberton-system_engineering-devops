> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers network concepts for DevOps development

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:


* What it's OSI
* How many layers it has an OSI
* How it is organized an OSI
* What is a LAN
* Typical usage of a LAN
* Typical geographical size of a LAN
* What is a WAN
* Typical usage of a WAN
* Typical geographical size a WAN
* What is the Internet 
* What is an IP address
* What are the 2 types of IP address
* What is localhost
* What is a subnet
* Why IPv6 was created
* What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)
* What is the main difference between TCP and UDP
* What is a port
* Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
* What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. OSI model
1. Types of network
2. MAC and IP address
3. UDP and TCP 
4. TCP and UDP ports
5. Is the host on the network
