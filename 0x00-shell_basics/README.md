## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Script that prints the absolute path name of the current working directory.
1. Script that display the contents list of your current directory.
2. Script that changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory.
3. Script that display current directory contents in a long format
4. Script that display current directory contents, including hidden files (starting with .). Use the long format.
5. Script that display current directory contents.
6. Script that creates a directory named holberton in the /tmp/ directory.
7. Script that move the file betty from /tmp/ to /tmp/holberton. 
8. Script that delete the file betty
9. Script that delete the directory holberton that is in the /tmp directory.
10. Script that changes the working directory to the previous one
11. Script that lists all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format.
12. Script that prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the /tmp directory when we will run your script.
13. symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__. The symbolic link should be created in the current working directory.
14. Script that copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory.
15. Script that moves all files beginning with an uppercase letter to the directory /tmp/u.
16. Script that deletes all files in the current working directory that end with the character ~.
17. Script that creates the directories welcome/, welcome/to/ and welcome/to/holberton in the current directory.
18. Command that lists all the files and directories of the current directory, separated by commas (,).
19. Magic file holberton.mgc that can be used with the command file to detect Holberton data files. Holberton data files always contain the string HOLBERTON at offset 0.
