# 0x15 API :wrench:

> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers API management for system adminsitrations.

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* What Bash scripting should not be used for
* What is an API
* What is a REST API
* What are microservices
* What is the CSV format
* What is the JSON format
* Pythonic Package and module name style
* Pythonic Class name style
* Pythonic Variable name style
* Pythonic Function name style
* Pythonic Constant name style
* Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python


## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0.Sript that, using this REST API, for a given employee ID, returns information about his/her TODO list progress.
1. Script to export data in the CSV format.
2. Script to export data in the JSON format.
3. Script to export data in the JSON format. v2
