# 0x0A Configuration management :wrench:

> DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from Agile methodology. This project covers the configuration management of automation tasks in CI/CD

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the * sysadmin/devops track projects
* You must be able to explain what each component is doing
* You must be able to explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS
