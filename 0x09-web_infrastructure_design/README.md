# 0x09 Web infrastructure design :wrench:

> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers we infrastructure development

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the * sysadmin/devops track projects
* You must be able to explain what each component is doing
* You must be able to explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS


## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Design of a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via www.foobar.com
1. Design of a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.
2. Design of a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.
3. Design of an application server vs web server
