# 0x06 Regular expression :wrench:

> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers regular expressions

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* Regular expressions - basics
* Regular expressions - advanced
* Rubular
* Use a regular expression against a problem

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. Script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method v0
1. Script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method v1
2. Script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method v2
3. Script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method v3
4. Script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method v4
5. Script that accepts one argument and pass it to a regular expression matching method v5
6. Script of regular expression must match a 10 digit phone number
7. Script of regular expression must be only matching: capital letters
9. Script that output: [SENDER],[RECEIVER],[FLAGS] The sender phone number or name (including country code if present) The receiver phone number or name (including country code if present) The flags that were used
10. Script that indefinitely writes I am alive! to the file /tmp/my_process
11. LinkedIn regex puzzle
