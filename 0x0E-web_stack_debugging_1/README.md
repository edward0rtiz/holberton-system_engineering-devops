# 0x0E Web stack debugging #1 :wrench:

> Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually. This project covers a second part of the optimal framework and blueprint for debugging web stack (remote containers this scenario) bugs

Challenge:

Using your debugging skills, find out what’s keeping your Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation from listening on port 80. Feel free to install whatever tool you need, start and destroy as many containers as you need to debug the issue.


## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:
