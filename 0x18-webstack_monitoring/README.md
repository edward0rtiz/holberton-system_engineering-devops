# 0x18 Webstack monitoring :wrench:

> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers monitoring techniques and usage of external tool for system adminsitrations in real environemnt.

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* Why is monitoring needed
* What are the 2 main area of monitoring
* What are access logs for a web server (such as Nginx)
* What are error logs for a web server (such as Nginx)


## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:

Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)
