# 0x04 Loops, conditions and parsing :wrench:

> Using a shell script is most useful for repetitive tasks that may be time consuming to execute by typing one line at a time. A few examples of applications shell scripts can be used for include: Automating the code compiling process. Running a program or creating a program environment. This project covers programming in bash using loops conditions and parsing techniques

At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

* How to create SSH keys
* What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
* How to use while, until and for loops
* How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
* How to use the cut command
* What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

## Tasks :heavy_check_mark:

0. RSA key pair
1. Script that displays Holberton School 10 times.
2. Script that displays Holberton School 10 times. v2
3. Script that displays Holberton School 10 times. v3
4. Script that displays Holberton School 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, displays Holberton School and then Hi on a new line
5. Script that loops from 1 to 10
6. Script that displays numbers from 1 to 20
7. Script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes
8. Script that that displays the content of the current directory in a list format Where only the part of the name after the first dash is displayed 
9. Script that gives you information about the holbertonschool file.
10. Script that displays numbers from 1 to 100.
11. Script that displays the content of the file /etc/passwd.
12. Script that that displays the content of the file /etc/passwd, using the while loop + IFS.
13. Script that displays the visitor IP along with the HTTP status code from the Apache log file
14. Script that groups visitors by IP and HTTP status code, and displays this data.
